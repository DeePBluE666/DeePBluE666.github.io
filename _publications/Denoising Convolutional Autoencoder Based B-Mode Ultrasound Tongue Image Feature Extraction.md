**Abstrcat**

B-mode ultrasound tongue imaging is widely used in the speech production field. However, efficient interpretation is in a great need for the tongue image sequences. 
Inspired by the recent success of unsupervised deep learning approach, we explore unsupervised convolutional network architecture for the feature extraction in the 
ultrasound tongue image, which can be helpful for the clinical linguist and phonetics. By quantitative comparison between different unsupervised feature extraction 
approaches, the denoising convolutional autoencoder (DCAE)-based method outperforms the other feature extraction methods on the reconstruction task and the 2010 
silent speech interface challenge. A Word Error Rate of 6.17% is obtained with DCAE, compared to the state-of-the-art value of 6.45% using Discrete cosine transform 
as the feature extractor.
