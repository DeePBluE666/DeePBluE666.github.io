**Abstract**

With the advert of IOT and the increasing usage of smart devices, the generated data has increased exponentially. The capacity of the machine learning approaches, 
can be improved by using more high quality labeled data, which are often stored in independent devices. Most of the traditional machine learning approaches require 
centralizing the multiparty data to train a model, using a central server to store the data, with the goal to obtain superior performance. Federated machine learning 
can be employed to address aforementioned issues without centralizing the data. In this paper, we propose a vertical federated learning framework using multi-task 
learning. And, our approach employs partly shared model to protect the privacy. In a practical environment, we conduct extensive experiments on the cross-lingual 
short-text matching task. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
