In practical scenario, relation extraction needs to fifirst identify entity pairs that have relation and then assign a correct relation class. 
However, the number of non-relation entity pairsin context (negative instances) usually far ex- ceeds the others (positive instances), which negatively 
affects a modelâ€™s performance. To mitigate this problem, we propose a multi-task architecture which jointly trains a model to perform relation identifification 
with cross entropy loss and relation classifification with ranking loss. Meanwhile, we observe that asentence may have multiple entities and relation mentions, 
and the patterns in which the entities appear in a sentence may contain useful semantic information that can be utilized to distinguish between positive and negative 
instances. Thus we further incorporate the embeddings of character-wise/word-wise BIO tag from the named entity recognition task into character/word embeddings to 
enrichthe input representation. Experiment results show that our proposed approach can signifificantly improve the performance of a baseline model with more than 10% 
absolute increase in F1-score, and outperform the state-of-the-art models on ACE 2005 Chinese and English corpus. Moreover, BIO tag embeddings are particularly 
effective and can be used to improve other models as well.
