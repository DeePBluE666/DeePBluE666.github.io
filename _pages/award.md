###  Kaggle Competition Master

###  Excellent Undergraduate Thesis of University of Jinan


>**Part2: Competition Awards** 

* **21. CIKM AnalytiCup 2018:  Cross-Language Short Text Matching**
  * Field: Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing
  * Rank: 3/1027
  * Details: 
	* The contest provide a large number of unlabeled English corpus, marked Spanish corpus and corresponding English translation. The task is to determine whether the given two Spanish languages contain similar semantics.
    * Unlabeled corpus is used to train word2vec, and TF-IDF statistics is used to modify the weight of word vectors to make full use of English unlabeled corpus.
    * Building a multi-task learning model, to process Spanish and English at the same time. The performance of semantic similarity judgment is significant improved by partially sharing parameters and LSTM layer.

	
* **20. IJCAI 2018:  Click Transformation Rate Prediction**
  * Field: Machine Learning and Data Mining 
  * Rank: 5/5024(Top 0.1%)
  * Details: 
	* The context provide users’ search and click records and predicts what they will buy on promotional day.
    * Building a purchasing in ordinary time period based on a large number of handcrafted features.
    * Perform transfer learning to predict the results of the above models are taken as the features of the promotional day, to significant improves the performance of the models.	
	

* **19. KDD2018:  Weather Prediction**
  * Field: Deep Learning and Data Mining 
  * Rank: 7/4170(Top 0.2%)
  * Details: 
	* The competition provides the weather data about Beijing and London over the past few weeks, the task is to predict the weather conditions of the two cities in the future.
    * Using LSTM and CapsuleNet hybrid model and stacking ensemble model to build a weather forecasting system.	


* **18. Kaggle:  TGS Salt Identification Challenge**
  * Field: Deep Learning and Computer Vision 
  * Rank: 10/3234(Gold Medal)
  * Details: 
	* The context require to build an algorithm that automatically and accurately identifies if a subsurface target is salt.
    * Using different data argumentation techniques.	
	* Built a U-net with ResNet Blocks model to solve the problem.

* **17. Tianchi:  Medical Knowledge Graph Challenge**
  * Field: Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing 
  * Rank: 2/1029
  * Details: 
	* The context given a large number of corpus in medical field and require the contestants to build the knowledge graph, obtains the entities from the corpus, and extracts the relationship between entities.
    * Established a joint training model of entity recognition and relation extraction to solved simultaneously.	
	* The BIO information of entities is introduced to the relation extraction model, which greatly improves the performance of the model.	
	* Obtain dynamic entity vectors through entity vector pre-training model, similar to language model.
