####  Competition Master at Kaggle

####  Excellent Undergraduate Thesis of University of Jinan


>Competition Awards

* **CIKM AnalytiCup 2018:  Cross-Language Short Text Matching**
  * Field: Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing
  * Rank: 3/1027
  * Details: 
	* The contest provide a large number of unlabeled English corpus, marked Spanish corpus and corresponding English translation. The task is to determine whether the given two Spanish languages contain similar semantics.
    * Unlabeled corpus is used to train word2vec, and TF-IDF statistics is used to modify the weight of word vectors to make full use of English unlabeled corpus.
    * Building a multi-task learning model, to process Spanish and English at the same time. The performance of semantic similarity judgment is significant improved by partially sharing parameters and LSTM layer.

	
* **IJCAI 2018:  Click Transformation Rate Prediction**
  * Field: Machine Learning and Data Mining 
  * Rank: 5/5024(Top 0.1%)
  * Details: 
	* The context provide usersâ€™ search and click records and predicts what they will buy on promotional day.
    * Building a purchasing in ordinary time period based on a large number of handcrafted features.
    * Perform transfer learning to predict the results of the above models are taken as the features of the promotional day, to significant improves the performance of the models.	
	

* **KDD2018:  Weather Prediction**
  * Field: Deep Learning and Data Mining 
  * Rank: 7/4170(Top 0.2%)
  * Details: 
	* The competition provides the weather data about Beijing and London over the past few weeks, the task is to predict the weather conditions of the two cities in the future.
    * Using LSTM and CapsuleNet hybrid model and stacking ensemble model to build a weather forecasting system.	


* **Kaggle:  TGS Salt Identification Challenge**
  * Field: Deep Learning and Computer Vision 
  * Rank: 10/3234(Gold Medal)
  * Details: 
	* The context require to build an algorithm that automatically and accurately identifies if a subsurface target is salt.
    * Using different data argumentation techniques.	
	* Built a U-net with ResNet Blocks model to solve the problem.

* **Tianchi:  Medical Knowledge Graph Challenge**
  * Field: Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing 
  * Rank: 2/1029
  * Details: 
	* The context given a large number of corpus in medical field and require the contestants to build the knowledge graph, obtains the entities from the corpus, and extracts the relationship between entities.
    * Established a joint training model of entity recognition and relation extraction to solved simultaneously.	
	* The BIO information of entities is introduced to the relation extraction model, which greatly improves the performance of the model.	
	* Obtain dynamic entity vectors through entity vector pre-training model, similar to language model.

## Buttons

Make any link standout more when applying the `.btn` class.

## Notices

**Watch out!** You can also add notices by appending `{: .notice}` to a paragraph.
{: .notice}

## HTML Tags

### Address Tag

<address>
  1 Infinite Loop<br /> Cupertino, CA 95014<br /> United States
</address>

### Anchor Tag (aka. Link)

This is an example of a [link](http://github.com "Github").

### Abbreviation Tag

The abbreviation CSS stands for "Cascading Style Sheets".

*[CSS]: Cascading Style Sheets

### Cite Tag

"Code is poetry." ---<cite>Automattic</cite>

### Code Tag

You will learn later on in these tests that `word-wrap: break-word;` will be your best friend.

### Strike Tag

This tag will let you <strike>strikeout text</strike>.

### Emphasize Tag

The emphasize tag should _italicize_ text.

### Insert Tag

This tag should denote <ins>inserted</ins> text.

### Keyboard Tag

This scarcely known tag emulates <kbd>keyboard text</kbd>, which is usually styled like the `<code>` tag.

### Preformatted Tag

This tag styles large blocks of code.

<pre>
.post-title {
  margin: 0 0 5px;
  font-weight: bold;
  font-size: 38px;
  line-height: 1.2;
  and here's a line of some really, really, really, really long text, just to see how the PRE tag handles it and to find out how it overflows;
}
</pre>

### Quote Tag

<q>Developers, developers, developers&#8230;</q> &#8211;Steve Ballmer

### Strong Tag

This tag shows **bold text**.

### Subscript Tag

Getting our science styling on with H<sub>2</sub>O, which should push the "2" down.

### Superscript Tag

Still sticking with science and Isaac Newton's E = MC<sup>2</sup>, which should lift the 2 up.

### Variable Tag

This allows you to denote <var>variables</var>.
