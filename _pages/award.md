>Competition Awards

* **CIKM AnalytiCup 2018:  Cross-Language Short Text Matching**
  * Field: Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing
  * Rank: 3/1027
  * Details: 
	* The contest provide a large number of unlabeled English corpus, marked Spanish corpus and corresponding English translation. The task is to determine whether the given two Spanish languages contain similar semantics.
    * Unlabeled corpus is used to train word2vec, and TF-IDF statistics is used to modify the weight of word vectors to make full use of English unlabeled corpus.
    * Building a multi-task learning model, to process Spanish and English at the same time. The performance of semantic similarity judgment is significant improved by partially sharing parameters and LSTM layer.

	
* **IJCAI 2018:  Click Transformation Rate Prediction**
  * Field: Machine Learning and Data Mining 
  * Rank: 5/5024(Top 0.1%)
  * Details: 
	* The context provide users’ search and click records and predicts what they will buy on promotional day.
    * Building a purchasing in ordinary time period based on a large number of handcrafted features.
    * Perform transfer learning to predict the results of the above models are taken as the features of the promotional day, to significant improves the performance of the models.
