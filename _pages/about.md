Hi! I'm Bo Li, a PhD student at National Engineering Research Center for Software Engineering at **Peking University** in Beijing, China. I majored in Knowledge Computing and Information Processing. I'm interested in **Data Science** and **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** technology, especially **Deep Learning (DL)**. I am currently working on **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**.

Since 2018, I paid lots of attention to my research as I became interested in building new models and proposing some new methods in DL. I've published 
several papers on NLP and other related topics in different journals and conferences. 
[**More details can be found in Publications.**](https://deepblue666.github.io//publications/)

Beseide, some of my previous work focuses on the applications of machine learning and deep learning methods, I've worked for many internet companies, 
participated in some projects, [**More details can be found in Projects.**](https://deepblue666.github.io//project/) and won top3 awards
in many data science competitions. [**More details can be found in Awards.**](https://deepblue666.github.io//award/) I'm also a Kaggle Competition Master and data scientist at Tianchi (rank 89/44392). 


My Resume is available [here](https://deepblue666.github.io//cv/)
