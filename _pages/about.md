Hi! I'm Bo Li, a graduate student at Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications in Beijing, China. I majored in Information Processing and Data Mining. 
I'm now a research intern at National Engineering Research Center for Software Engineering at Peking University. 

I'm interested in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology, especially Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL). I am currently working on Natural 
Language Processing (NLP) and Reinforcement Learning (RL).

Most of my previous work has been on the applications of machine learning and deep learning methods, I've been worked for many internet companies, and won top10 awards
in many data science competitions. I'm also a Competition Master at Kaggle and data scientist at Tianchi (rank 89/44392). More details can be found in Awards.

Since 2018, I paid more attention to my research as I become interested in building new models and proposing some new methods in ML and DL. I've published 
several papers on AI and other related topics in different journals and conferences. More details can be seen in Publications.

Feel free to contact with me
