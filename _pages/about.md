Hi! I'm Bo Li, a graduate student at Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications in Beijing, China. 
Now I'm a research intern at National Engineering Research Center for Software Engineering at Peking University. 
I'm interested in Data Science and other Artificial Intelligence(AI) technologies. I majored in Machine Learning(ML) and Deep Learning(DL), currently I worked on Natural Language Processing(NLP) and Reinforcement Learning(RL) fields.
Most of my previous work has focus on the applications of machine learning and deep learning methods, I've been worked for many internet companies, and won lots of 
data science competitions top10 awards. Besides, I'am a competition master at Kaggle and data scientist at Tianchi(rank 89/44392), more details can be found in Awards.
Since 2018, I paid more attention to my research work, I found it's interesting and exciting to build new models and propose some new methods on AI fields. I've published 
several papers on different journals and conferences, more details can be seen in Publications.

Feel free to concat with me.
