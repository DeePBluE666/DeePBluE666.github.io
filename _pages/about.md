Hi! I'm Bo Li, a graduate student at **Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications** in Beijing, China. I majored in Information Processing and Data Mining. 
I'm now a research intern at National Engineering Research Center for Software Engineering at **Peking University**. 

I'm interested in **Data Science** and **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** technology, especially **Deep Learning (DL)**. I am currently working on **Natural 
Language Processing (NLP)** and **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**.

Most of my previous work focuses on the applications of machine learning and deep learning methods, I've been worked for many internet companies, 
participated in some projects, [**More details can be found in Projects.**](https://deepblue666.github.io//project/) and won top3 awards
in many data science competitions. I'm also a Competition Master at Kaggle and data scientist at Tianchi (rank 89/44392). 
[**More details can be found in Awards.**](https://deepblue666.github.io//award/)

Since 2018, I paid more attention to my research as I became interested in building new models and proposing some new methods in ML and DL. I've published 
several papers on AI and other related topics in different journals and conferences.
