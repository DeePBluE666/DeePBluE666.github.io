Hi! I'm Bo Li, a graduate student at Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications in Beijing, China. I majored in Information Processing and Data Mining. 
Now I'm a research intern at National Engineering Research Center for Software Engineering at Peking University. 

I'm interested in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence(AI) technologies, especially Machine Learning(ML) and Deep Learning(DL), currently I worked on Natural 
Language Processing(NLP) and Reinforcement Learning(RL).

Most of my previous work has focus on the applications of machine learning and deep learning methods, I've been worked for many internet companies, and won lots of 
data science competitions with top10 awards. Besides, I'm a Competition Master at Kaggle and data scientist at Tianchi(rank 89/44392), more details can be found in Awards.

Since 2018, I paid more attention on my research work, I found it's interesting and exciting to build new models and propose some new methods on AI fields. I've published 
several papers about AI and other related topic on different journals and conferences, more details can be seen in Publications.

Feel free to concat with me
